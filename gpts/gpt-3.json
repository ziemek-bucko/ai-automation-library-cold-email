Here's a proven framework:\nStep 1 (Day 1): Initial outreach with a focus on a specific pain point (e.g., \"Save 10+ hours on manual reporting\").\nStep 2 (Day 4): Follow-up with a case study or a short video showing the product in action.\nStep 3 (Day 8): Provide a valuable resource, like a whitepaper on financial reporting trends.\nStep 4 (Day 14): The \"break-up\" email. A polite final attempt to connect.",
